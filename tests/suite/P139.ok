SECTION 139.1: PERMUTATION TEST FOR THE RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM TESTS TO SEE THAT WITHIN FIXED SIZE GROUPS
OF RANDOM NUMBERS, ALL ORDERS OF THE VALUES ARE EQUALLY
PROBABLE. CHI-SQUARE IS COMPUTED AND DISPLAYED TO SEE
WHETHER THE RESULTS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE EXPECTED
EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION FOR UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBERS.

***** THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY *****

                 BEGIN TEST

(EXPECTED COUNT = 10 FOR ALL CASES.)
