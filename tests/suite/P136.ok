SECTION 136.1: GAP TEST FOR RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM TESTS THAT THE GAPS BETWEEN NUMBERS WITHIN
A SPECIFIED INTERVAL ARE DISTRIBUTED AS EXPECTED FOR
UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED RANDOM NUMBERS. CHI-SQUARE IS
COMPUTED AND DISPLAYED AS THE RESULT.

***** THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY. *****

                    BEGIN TEST


WILL RUN  259  TRIALS, SO THAT EACH POSSIBILITY HAS
EXPECTED VALUE >= 10.
