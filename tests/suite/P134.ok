SECTION 134.1: KOMOLGOROV-SMIRNOV UNIFORMITY TEST FOR
        RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM RUNS 30 TESTS OF 1000 SAMPLES EACH TO CHECK
UNIFORMITY OF DISTRIBUTION OF RANDOM NUMBERS. KOMOLGOROV-
SMIRNOV (K-S) STATISTICS (K+ AND K-) ARE GENERATED FOR
EACH TEST. THESE TWO NUMBERS ARE A MEASURE OF THE GREATEST
DEVIATION, IN THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE DIRECTION, OF THE
ACCUMULATION OF THE 1000 NUMBERS FROM THE IDEAL DISTRIBUTION
OF F(X)=X, 0<=X<1.

THESE TWO SETS (K+ AND K-) OF 30 STATISTICS THEMSELVES HAVE
AN EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION OF F(X) = 1 - EXP(-2*X*X). THE
K-S TEST IS RUN AGAIN ON EACH OF THESE TWO SETS, AND IF
THE DEVIATION IS TOO GREAT (TOP OR BOTTOM 1%) FOR ANY ONE 
OF THE RESULTING STATISTICS, THEN THE TEST FAILS.
