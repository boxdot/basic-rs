PROGRAM FILE 117: ACCURACY OF SQR FUNCTION.
    ANSI STANDARD 7.6, 8.4

SECTION 117.1: ACCURACY OF SQR FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM TESTS VALUES RETURNED BY INVOCATIONS OF THE
SQR FUNCTION FOR ACCURACY. THE INVOCATION MUST RETURN,
ACCURATE TO SIX DIGITS, SOME VALUE ACTUALLY TAKEN ON BY
THE FUNCTION WITHIN A DOMAIN BOUNDED BY THE ACTUAL ARGUMENT
PLUS OR MINUS ONE IN THE SIXTH DIGIT. ALSO, AN
'ERROR MEASURE' IS COMPUTED AND REPORTED. THIS MEASURE
IS JUST 2 * THE ABSOLUTE ERROR OVER THE SIZE OF THE RANGE;
THUS, A VALUE JUST BARELY PASSING OR FAILING WILL USUALLY
HAVE A MEASURE OF ABOUT 1. A VALUE 3 TIMES
AS INACCURATE AS EXPECTED WILL HAVE A MEASURE OF 3.

THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY, SINCE THE ANSI STANDARD
DOES NOT MANDATE ANY ACCURACY FOR SUPPLIED-FUNCTIONS.
