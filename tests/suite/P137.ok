    ANSI STANDARD 8.4

SECTION 137.1: POKER TEST FOR RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM CATEGORIZES FIXED-SIZE GROUPS OF RANDOM NUMBERS
BASED ON HOW MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF NUMBER ARE IN EACH
GROUP. A TYPE IS DETERMINED BY WHICH FRACTION OF THE 0 - 1
SEGMENT THE VALUE OF THE NUMBER FALLS WITHIN. CHI-SQUARE
IS THEN COMPUTED AND DISPLAYED AS THE RESULT TO SEE IF
IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION FOR UNIFORM
RANDOM NUMBERS.

***** THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY *****

                    BEGIN TEST

RUNNING  12005  TRIALS, SO THAT EACH POSSIBILITY HAS
EXPECTED VALUE >= 5, AS NEEDED FOR CHI-SQUARE TEST.

#TYPES        ACTUAL COUNT  EXPECTED COUNT
 1             7             5 
 2             443           450 
 3             3745          3750 
 4             5965          6000 
 5             1845          1800 

FOR FOUR D.F., SHOULD HAVE .710721 <= CHI-SQ <= 9.48773
(5% TAIL AT EACH END.)

ACTUAL CHI-SQ =  2.24472 

*** INFORMATIVE TEST PASSED ***

                   END TEST
